1. Download a pretrained yolo model and place it in the 'part_1' directory.
2. Run 'sort.py' to create the necessary train and test folders.
3. To train the model, run 'train.py'
4. To have the model predict the bounding boxes, run 'inference.py'
    - You can change which images it predicts bounding boxes for by changing the image files in the 'inference.py' script
5. The images with the predicted bounding boxes are in the 'results' directory.
